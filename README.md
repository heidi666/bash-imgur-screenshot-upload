bash-imgur-screenshot-upload
============================

No faff bash script for uploading screenshots to imgur.

Requires scrot and xclip.

After launching the script (I recommend binding to a keyboard shortcut like F9), select the area you want to capture.
When you release, it will upload the image anonymously to imgur and copy the resulting url to your clipboard ready for ctrl-V!
It will also notify you upon completion.
